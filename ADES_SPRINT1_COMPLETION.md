3. **Commit Analyzer** (`internal/ades/analyzer/`) - Intelligent commit analysis
4. **Pattern Detector** (`internal/ades/patterns/`) - Multi-language pattern recognition
5. **Main Service** (`internal/ades/service.go`) - Orchestration and business logic
6. **API Integration** (`internal/api/ades_handlers.go`) - RESTful endpoints
7. **GAIT Integration** (`main.go`) - Seamless integration

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Database Schema

## 🔮 Vision Realized

Sprint 1 successfully demonstrates the core concept of ADES:
> **"Using Git commit history as a living knowledge base that AI assistants can query to provide contextual, project-specific development assistance."**

The foundation is now in place for AI assistants to:
- Query real development experiences from Git history
- Understand project-specific patterns and conventions
- Provide contextual suggestions based on actual usage
- Learn from successful development approaches

## 🎊 Conclusion

Sprint 1 of ADES has been a resounding success! We've built a solid foundation that transforms Git commit history into a queryable knowledge base for AI-assisted development. The system is working, tested, and ready for the next phase of development.

**Key Achievement**: We've proven that Git history can be effectively transformed into structured development experiences that AI assistants can query and use for contextual assistance.
